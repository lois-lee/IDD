**Lois Lee's Final Project**

**Project Idea**
Haptically and visually provide the amplitude and pitch of sounds. 

**Interaction plan:** 
By putting one's hand so that they hit all of the rings, they can feel the different rings vibrating with the music. The LEDs help to visualize the music as well.

**Team**
Working solo!


**Hardware needed**
* microphone (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1063)
* OLED display 
* FSR (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9375)
* 27kohm resistors; 220ohm resistors
* adafruit metro mini
* button 


**Pinouts**
* 1, 2, 7, 8, 12, 13 are the led pins
* 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 are the pwms on the metro for the vibration motors
* A3 is for the mic
* A1 also for vibration motors
* A0, A2 is for the capacitive sensor to swap from mode to mode
* A4, A5 are for the OLED display

**Functionality**

Number of them on = amplitude.
Superimposed frequencies = frequency.

Can increase amplitude by tapping capacitive FSR sensor.
